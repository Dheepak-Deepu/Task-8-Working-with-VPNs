## ‚ùì Interview Questions

1. What is a VPN?**  
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a secure tunnel between your device and the internet that encrypts data and masks your IP.

2. How does a VPN protect privacy?**  
By hiding your real IP address and encrypting your online activities from ISPs, hackers, or trackers.

3. Difference between VPN and proxy?**  
- **VPN** encrypts all device traffic  
- **Proxy** only forwards browser/app traffic without encryption

4. What is encryption in VPN?**  
Encryption secures your internet data using protocols like **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, or **IKEv2**, making it unreadable to outsiders.

5. Can VPN guarantee complete anonymity?**  
No. It improves privacy but doesn‚Äôt make you 100% anonymous ‚Äî your activity can still be tracked if you log in to personal accounts or use a logging VPN.

6. What protocols do VPNs use?**  
- OpenVPN  
- WireGuard  
- IKEv2/IPSec  
- L2TP/IPSec

7. What are some VPN limitations?**  
Speed drop, limited free access, no built-in malware protection, possible logging.

8. How does a VPN affect network speed?**  
VPN routes your traffic through remote servers, which may reduce speed depending on distance and server load.
